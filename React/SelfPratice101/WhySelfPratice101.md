##**Welcome to SelfPratice101**

So this is a self pratice folder where I will create different kind of project form beginner to advance (or just little advance).

The reason for this is to get the real and logical thinking while making a project on React.
In the learning phase of frontend I learned REACT where i know

1. React
2. Vite
3. Redux/ReduxToolKit
4. react-router-dom
5. AppWrite (A backend service)

I have learned and understand what they do, but I-myself can properly use it. So to make my self confident I will be practicing it mySelf.
